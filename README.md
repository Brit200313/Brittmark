#Brittmark

An application that allows users to bookmark URLs via email, peruse other user's bookmarks and maintain a personal index of categorized bookmarks. 

#Usecase

It's easy enough to bookmark a URL in your browser, but eventually your bookmark library may get cluttered and it may require effort to find and manage bookmarks. Brittmark has the ability to share bookmarks with friends, which is not something we can do easily from our native browser. Brittmark solves these problems by organizing bookmarks by topic and making them public so that other users can find them and add bookmarks to their own Brittmarks index.
